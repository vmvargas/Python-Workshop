    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites:\n",
    "1. Previous programming experience (either in Python or in another language)\n",
    "2. Set up the environment:\n",
    "    - Install the latest version of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) for **Python 3.6**\n",
    "    - Lunch a Jupyter notebook\n",
    "    \n",
    "## About me\n",
    "\n",
    "I am a GA/ web developer at lubin and president and founder of the AI Club.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm in the last semester of an MS in CS focused on AI and ML, currently working on several deep learning academic projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer for about 3 years, wearing multiple hats, front-end, back-end, self-employed, android developer, manager, and BI analyst. I have worked with consultancies, marketing organizations, and freelance projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’m from Venezuela thus I also speak Spanish.\n",

    "\n",
    "## About Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an incredibly efficient language: your programs will do more in fewer lines of code than many other languages would require. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s syntax will also help you write *clean* code. Your code will be easy to read, easy to debug, and easy to extend and build upon compared to other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "People use Python for many purposes: \n",
    "- to make games, \n",
    "- build web applications,\n",
    "- solve business problems, \n",
    "- develop internal tools for all kinds of interesting companies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is also used heavily in scientific fields for academic research and applied work.\n",
